Nile River is -41.891348, 171.446051
Box Thumb is -43.584836, 172.789900

I did some calculations based on photos. i think BT is about 14.0 deg slope and NR is about 20.6 deg slope. BT is initially steep - almost vertical - but then very flat, so it depends how high you want to go.


Thanks so much for meeting earlier today to talk about joining our NZ mussel MS as a collaborator! Here's a brief summary of what we talked about - please let me know if there's anything you'd add or change to these notes.Timeline & tasks: by March 15:Allison will run modelCascade & other coauthors (cc-ed) will work on text revisions not related to the new modelingObjective: use Allison's model (previously developed and validated with robo mussel data) to estimate mussel body temperature and frequency of conditions exceeding tolerance limits (LT50) for 3 NZ mussel speciesMetric to calculate: time (length of contiguous period) above lethal thermal limit (across sites, tide heights, and bed depths over ~10-30 years & in the future)Sites:1. Nile River - 41.90°S, 171.44°E2. Box Thumb - 43.58°S, 172.78°ELT50 values: thresholds for assessing frequency exceeded, differs by site:1. Nile River - Perna=31.8, Aulacomya=31.8, M. gallo=35.22. Box Thumb - Perna=33.3, Aulacomya=33.1, M. gallo=37.9Tide heights: We didn't come to a final conclusion on this but perhaps from 0 m to 2.3 m (or a "square" 2.5 m - 2.3 m was the max upper tide height limit for M. gallo measured by our transects)at intervals of 0.1 m?Bed depth: Estimate body temperature at bed surface and 1+ estimates within the bedRange of bed depths: 5, 20, 35, 50, 65 mm (or does this 15 mm interval look to messy?) Minimum bed depth for M. gallo is 5 mm and max for Perna is 60 on average (although we did measure as deep as 100 mm). Average depth when dominated by M. gallo and Perna is 21 and 35 mm respectively (so hence the 15 mm interval)Temperature data: Monitoring stations that we used previously were from https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/ at Greymouth (42.46°S, 171.19°E) and Christchurch 204 (43.53°S, 172.61°E)Future projections: Allison will incorporate regional (NZ South Island) warming predictions for year 2100Also to consider for text:1. Discuss impact of temperature vs. duration on estimates of lethal thermal limits for context in interpreting our results re: length of time above thermal limit; cite Allison's work (duration matters very close to the lethal limit but far from the limit, it matters less)2. Possibly compare surface and total abundance estimates (i.e., percent cover vs. species counts in cores) to show that Aulacomya often occurs within the bed matrix, for implications about which of the body temperature estimates (surface or within bed) is most appropriate for estimating Aulacomya tide height limitsDavid's initial suggestions/email are copied below. Please let us know if there's anything else you need from us. Thanks, again - I'm so glad to have this impetus and opportunity to work together!
